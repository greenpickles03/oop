//OOP
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that uses "objects" to design software. It focuses on
the concepts of encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction to create modular and reusable code.
Here are the four main principles of OOP in Java:

* Abstraction in java is the process of hiding the complex implementation details and showing only the essential
features of the object. It helps in reducing programming complexity and effort. Abstraction can be achieved using
abstract classes and interfaces in Java.

// Example of Abstraction using Abstract Class
You have a abstract class and have abstract method to access this abstract method.
In the child class you have to extend the abstract class using the extends keyword.
In the main class you have to create the object of the child class to access the abstract method.

* Encapsulation in java is the process of wrapping the variables and methods into a single unit called class.
Encapsulation protects data from direct access or modification by making it private and exposing it
only through public methods.

// Example of Encapsulation
We have a class that have a private variables to access these private variables we have to create a
public methods called getter and setter methods.

* Inheritance in java is a mechanism where one class acquires the properties (fields) and behaviors (methods)
of another class, using the extends keyword. It promotes code usability and establishes a relationship

// Example of Inheritance
We have a parent class and a child class. The child class inherit the properties and behavior of
the parent class using the extends keyword. In the main class we create the object of the child class to access the
methods of the parent class.

* Polymorphism in java is the ability of a single function or method to operate in different ways based on
the object that it is acting upon. It can be achieved through method overloading and method overriding.

// Example of Polymorphism
We have a class that have two methods with same name but different parameters this is called method overloading.
In method overriding we have a parent class and a child class the child class overrides the method of the parent class
and it have a @override annotation.

//Class
Class is a blueprint or template for creating objects. It defines the properties (attributes) and behaviors (methods)
of the objects that will be created from it. A class can contain fields, methods, constructors, and nested classes.
In Java, a class is defined using the "class" keyword followed by the class name and a pair of curly braces {} that
enclose the class body.03

//Object
An object is an instance of a class. It represents a specific realization of the class and contains its own set of data.
Objects are created using the "new" keyword followed by the class constructor. Each object has its own state and behavior
as defined by the class it is instantiated from.

//Singleton Class
The Singleton Pattern ensures that only one instance of a class exists throughout the application and provides
a global point of access to that instance.

// Example of Singleton Class
We have a class with a private static variable to hold the single instance of the class. The constructor is private to prevent
instantiation from outside the class. A public static method is provided to return the single instance of the class.

//DAO (Data Access Object)
DAO is a design pattern that provides an abstract interface to the database or other persistence mechanisms.
It separates the data access logic from the business logic, making it easier to manage and maintain the code.
A DAO typically contains methods for CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on the data source.

//Example of DAO Pattern
We have an interface that defines the methods for data access operations. A concrete class implements this interface
and provides the actual implementation for interacting with the database. The business logic can use the DAO interface
to perform data operations without worrying about the underlying database details.

//Lambda Expression
Lambda expressions in Java provide a clear and concise way to represent a single method interface (functional interface)
using an expression. They enable functional programming features in Java and allow for more readable and maintainable
code, especially when working with collections and streams.

A Lambda expression is a feature introduced in Java 8 that allows you to write anonymous functions (functions without a name).
It provides a clear and concise way to represent one method interface (functional interface) using a simple expression.

// Example of Lambda Expression
We have a functional interface with a single abstract method. A lambda expression is used to provide the implementation of that method.
The lambda expression can be assigned to a variable of the functional interface type and invoked like a regular method.

we have open and close parenthesis to define the parameters of the lambda expression followed by the arrow operator (->)
and then the body of the lambda expression.

//Stream API
Stream API is use to process collections of objects in a functional style. It provides a way to perform operations
like filtering, mapping, and reducing on data in a declarative manner. Streams can be created from collections, arrays, or I/O channels,
and they support parallel processing for improved performance.

// Example of Stream API
We have a list of integers and we want to filter out the even numbers, square them, and collect the results into a new list.
Using the Stream API, we can achieve this in a concise and readable way by chaining multiple operations together.
