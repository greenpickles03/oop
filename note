* Abstraction in java is the process of hiding the complex implementation details and showing only the essential
features of the object. It helps in reducing programming complexity and effort. Abstraction can be achieved using
abstract classes and interfaces in Java.

// Example of Abstraction using Abstract Class
You have a abstract class and have abstract method to access this abstract method.
In the child class you have to extend the abstract class using the extends keyword.
In the main class you have to create the object of the child class to access the abstract method.

* Encapsulation in java is the process of wrapping the variables and methods into a single unit called class.
Encapsulation protects data from direct access or modification by making it private and exposing it
only through public methods.

// Example of Encapsulation
We have a class that have a private variables to access these private variables we have to create a
public methods called getter and setter methods.

* Inheritance in java is a mechanism where one class acquires the properties (fields) and behaviors (methods)
of another class, using the extends keyword. It promotes code usability and establishes a relationship

// Example of Inheritance
We have a parent class and a child class. The child class extends the parent class using the extends keyword.
In the main class we create the object of the child class to access the methods of the parent class.

* Polymorphism in java is the ability of a single function or method to operate in different ways based on
the object that it is acting upon. It can be achieved through method overloading and method overriding.

// Example of Polymorphism
We have a class that have two methods with same name but different parameters this is called method overloading.
In method overriding we have a parent class and a child class the child class overrides the method of the parent class
and it have a @override annotation.
