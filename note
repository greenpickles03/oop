* Abstraction in java is the process of hiding the complex implementation details and showing only the essential
features of the object. It helps in reducing programming complexity and effort. Abstraction can be achieved using
abstract classes and interfaces in Java.

// Example of Abstraction using Abstract Class
You have a abstract class and have abstract method to access this abstract method.
In the child class you have to extend the abstract class using the extends keyword.
In the main class you have to create the object of the child class to access the abstract method.
